pseudocode:
1. we input no. of test cases
2. Then accept inputs for l,c,d
3. We know a cat and dog has 4 legs and connsidering other assumptions we calculate minimum no.of legs counted and maximum no.of legs 
4. for minimum we 4 multiply by no.of dogs
5. or if cats are more than minium = no.of cats minus no. of dogs which give us the no. of dog /cat on ground 
6. we multiply it by 4
7. for maximum scenario we have no. of cats + no.of dogs multiplied by 4
8. now if no.f legs = 0 or is greater than our minimum variable  then we print yes
9. Otherwise No

in_t = int(input())                                                     #no. of inputs
while(in_t != 0):
    c, d, l = map(int, input().split())                                # input no.of cat dogs and legs in c,d,l

        minimum = 4*d
    else:
        minimum = (c-d)*4                                              #if say we have 4 cats and 1 dogs that is no. of cats is greater than double of no.of dogs then we say

    maximum = (c+d)*4)                                                 #maximun no. of legs possible = all the cat legs + all the dogs legsi.e..4*(c+d) as each cat and dog has 4 legs max.
